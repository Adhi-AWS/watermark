## üìà Event Analytics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

#### Engagement Metrics
- **Average Session Duration**: Mean time spent per file
- **Interaction Rate**: Clicks and scrolls per minute
- **Sheet Navigation**: Multi-sheet engagement patterns
- **Return Rate**: Users accessing same file multiple times

#### Security Metrics
- **Violation Attempts**: Count of blocked actions per session
- **Risk Score**: Weighted score based on security events
- **Bypass Attempts**: Advanced security violation patterns
- **Compliance Rate**: Sessions without security violations

#### Operational Metrics
- **File Access Frequency**: Most and least accessed files
- **Peak Usage Times**: Time-based access patterns
- **Error Rate**: File access errors and failures
- **Print Volume**: Document printing frequency

### Sample Analytics Queries

#### Most Accessed Files
```sql
SELECT file_name, COUNT(*) as access_count
FROM activity_logs 
WHERE activity = 'FILE_OPENED'
GROUP BY file_name
ORDER BY access_count DESC;
```

#### Security Violations by Session
```sql
SELECT session_id, COUNT(*) as violation_count
FROM activity_logs 
WHERE activity LIKE '%BLOCKED%' OR activity LIKE '%ATTEMPT%'
GROUP BY session_id
ORDER BY violation_count DESC;
```

#### Average Session Duration
```sql
SELECT file_name, AVG(
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM 
    (SELECT timestamp FROM activity_logs al2 
     WHERE al2.session_id = al1.session_id 
     AND al2.activity = 'FILE_CLOSED' 
     LIMIT 1) -
    (SELECT timestamp FROM activity_logs al3 
     WHERE al3.session_id = al1.session_id 
     AND al3.activity = 'FILE_OPENED' 
     LIMIT 1)
  )
) as avg_duration_seconds
FROM activity_logs al1
WHERE activity = 'FILE_OPENED'
GROUP BY file_name;
```

## üîç Event Monitoring Best Practices

### Real-time Monitoring
1. **Set up alerts** for high-frequency security events
2. **Monitor session patterns** for unusual behavior
3. **Track file access trends** for capacity planning
4. **Watch for error spikes** indicating system issues

### Historical Analysis
1. **Weekly usage reports** showing file access patterns
2. **Monthly security summaries** highlighting violations
3. **Quarterly trend analysis** for business insights
4. **Annual compliance reports** for audit purposes

### Anomaly Detection
1. **Unusual access times** (outside business hours)
2. **High-frequency violations** from single sessions
3. **Rapid file switching** indicating automated access
4. **Geographic anomalies** (unexpected IP locations)
