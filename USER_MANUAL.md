## üîó Integration Guide

### Integration Methods

#### Method 1: Direct Link Replacement
Replace your existing download links:

**Before:**
```html
<a href="/download/confidential_report.xlsx">Download Report</a>
```

**After:**
```html
<a href="http://secure-viewer:5000/view/confidential_report.xlsx" target="_blank">
    View Secure Report
</a>
```

#### Method 2: Server-Side Redirect
Update your download endpoint:

**Flask Example:**
```python
@app.route('/download/<filename>')
def download_file(filename):
    # Instead of serving file, redirect to secure viewer
    return redirect(f'http://secure-viewer:5000/view/{filename}')
```

**Django Example:**
```python
from django.shortcuts import redirect

def download_file(request, filename):
    return redirect(f'http://secure-viewer:5000/view/{filename}')
```

#### Method 3: API Integration
Programmatically manage files:

```python
import requests

class SecureFileManager:
    def __init__(self, base_url):
        self.base_url = base_url
    
    def upload_file(self, file_path, filename):
        """Upload file to secure viewer"""
        with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
            files = {'file': (filename, f)}
            response = requests.post(f'{self.base_url}/api/upload', files=files)
        return response.json()
    
    def get_view_link(self, filename):
        """Get secure viewing link"""
        return f'{self.base_url}/view/{filename}'
    
    def get_activity_logs(self, filename=None):
        """Get activity logs for a file"""
        params = {'filename': filename} if filename else {}
        response = requests.get(f'{self.base_url}/api/logs', params=params)
        return response.json()

# Usage
manager = SecureFileManager('http://secure-viewer:5000')
link = manager.get_view_link('confidential_report.xlsx')
```

### Integration Examples

#### WordPress Plugin
```php
<?php
// WordPress shortcode for secure file links
function secure_file_shortcode($atts) {
    $atts = shortcode_atts(array(
        'file' => '',
        'title' => 'View File'
    ), $atts);
    
    $secure_url = 'http://secure-viewer:5000/view/' . $atts['file'];
    return sprintf('<a href="%s" target="_blank">%s</a>', $secure_url, $atts['title']);
}
add_shortcode('secure_file', 'secure_file_shortcode');

// Usage: [secure_file file="report.xlsx" title="View Report"]
?>
```

#### React Component
```jsx
import React from 'react';

const SecureFileLink = ({ filename, title, className }) => {
    const secureUrl = `http://secure-viewer:5000/view/${filename}`;
    
    return (
        <a 
            href={secureUrl} 
            target="_blank" 
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            className={className}
        >
            üîí {title}
        </a>
    );
};

// Usage: <SecureFileLink filename="report.xlsx" title="View Report" />
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Files Not Showing Up
**Problem**: Files placed in `secure_files/` directory don't appear on the main page

**Solutions:**
