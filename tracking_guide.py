üìä COMPREHENSIVE FILE TRACKING GUIDE
=====================================

This guide shows all the file tracking mechanisms implemented in your system.
"""

# 1. DOWNLOAD TRACKING
# ====================
# Location: app.py - download_secure() function

def track_download_event():
    """
    When a user downloads a file:
    1. File is automatically registered in tracking database
    2. Hash and fingerprint are generated
    3. System monitor is notified to watch for this file
    """

# 2. FILE ACCESS TRACKING
# ========================
# Location: excel_protection.py - VBA macros

def track_file_opening():
    """
    When downloaded file is opened:
    1. VBA macro executes on file open
    2. Sends HTTP request to Flask API
    3. Logs access time, user info, file details

# ======================
# Location: system_file_monitor.py

def track_file_copying():
    """
    When file is copied anywhere on system:
    1. Watchdog library monitors filesystem events
    2. Detects FILE_CREATED events for protected files
    3. Logs source and destination paths
    4. Sends security alert to Flask API
